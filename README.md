# cute

This is my personal ESLint config.

I work with Vue and Jest on most of my short-lived personal projects and enjoy using ESLint and Prettier on those.
However setting up a proper config everytime and keeping it in sync was getting annoying.
Hence cute, a set-and-forget ESLint config that does everything just how I like it.

Feel free to use it but it's **not stable at all*.

Once it settles down I might do a proper public release.
